I am a sixth-year PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at UC Davis. My research interests are in applications of
machine learning, particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning. I have worked at 
[Lacework](https://www.lacework.com/), [TotalEnergies](https://totalenergies.com/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
on data science and machine learning teams. I maintain [python-microgrid](https://github.com/ahalev/python-microgrid),
an open-source tertiary control microgrid simulator.
